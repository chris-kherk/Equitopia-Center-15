                    In horses, a small number of studies have emerged in periodic bursts as (I presume) individual PhD candidates dipped their toes into this difficult area. I can name the principal researchers and count them on one hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I leaped into the deep end, but was buoyed by research into other species that could be to some extent transferred to horses, and also the huge body of research that has been conducted into the effects of prematurity in humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mammalian species are not identical, but their similarities are legion, especially when it comes to anatomy and physiology. I came to love the other researchers who had produced papers that kept me afloat when what I was observing seemed just too wild to be true.

                    <p>
                        When we look at other species where there has been more research, namely humans, this should come as no surprise at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, the surprise is that we are failing to anticipate what amounts to a syndrome of <a href="https://www.equitopiacenter.com/"><u>prematurity and dysmaturity</u></a>. This is partly due to the research difficulties involved in longitudinal studies: it is mostly impractical to study horses over longer periods of time, while controlling against individual experiences that include every level of husbandry and management, and endless variations in training and riding style, and of course being sold. It is so much easier to research across the lifetime of cattle and sheep!

                    Another factor is the long ‘normal’ gestation period in horses and its variability. Many owners are fixed on the idea of a ‘due date’ of 340 days; often I’ve been told that a foal was premature, when it was earlier in the range of 320-360 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet while researching in the varied climates of the Australian east coast, it became very clear to me that the effect of temperatures are associated with  shorter gestations – my review of gestational length literature found latitude-related temperature effects to be a factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we have an effect of latitude, and within that altitude, we need to add to gender, breed, season, month, etc… In practice that helps us not much at all, as with so many variables at play, we can only consider the individual foal before us.
                </p>

                    Developmental programming issues that can appear in gestationally immature foals include joint and skeletal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology">pathologies</a>, as well as endocrinological differences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The latter often put the individuals at the end of research scales, where they are ruled out as statistical outliers – for me, they were the focus. Even then, the individuals vary considerable, hence my view that there is a syndromic effect of gestational immaturity, just as there is in humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, behavioural issues and learning difficulties appear to feature, and I was led in this not by research, but by owner reports. I was unable to establish sufficient case horses to evidence this aspect, but hold that affected horses may learn differently and that some may be more reactive in behavioural terms.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        To move this story along, here’s the lowdown from my own research which found that a lot of gestationally immature foals don’t just get over it and catch up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some do, but many don’t, and are left with one or more underlying issues that manifest as bigger problems later in life.
